WARNING: 'C' NOT READ FROM DATA INPUT FILE.
This means that fineSTRUCTURE may expect to see the wrong variance
in the data and you will probably experience poor clustering.
You are advised to use the 'chromocombine' tool to estimate 'C'.
See www.paintmychromosomes.com under 'ChromoCombine' for details.
